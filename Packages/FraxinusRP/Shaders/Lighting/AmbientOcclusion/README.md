Ground-truth ambient occlusion
=============================

The GTAO horizon search and cosine-weighted arc integration are adapted from
AkiKurisu's IllusionRP (https://github.com/AkiKurisu/IllusionRP, revision 91495f7),
whose implementation references bladesero/GTAO_URP and Unity HDRP.

Fraxinus supplies its own per-camera RenderGraph scheduling, half/quarter depth
reductions, projection reconstruction, normal decoding and texture bindings.
The bilateral spatial filter and combined blur/upsample retain depth-aware
visibility reconstruction, using explicit float2 visibility/linear-depth data
and bounded texture loads instead of packed bit patterns or a shared depth atlas.
Half-resolution reconstruction predicts each sample's closest depth on the local
surface plane. Two consecutive depth intervals must agree before they define a
slope, preserving occlusion on tilted surfaces while rejecting depth discontinuities.
There is no temporal accumulation or bent-normal output.
